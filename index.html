                      <b>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.</b>
                    </p>

                      <b>PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</b>

                  </div>
                  <p>This Notice of Privacy Practices describes how we may use and disclose your protected health information to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations and for other purposes that are permitted or required by law. It also describes your rights to access and control your protected health information. 'Protected health information' is information about you, including demographic information, that may identify you and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition and related health care services. We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice of Privacy Practices. We may change the terms of our notice, at any time. The new notice will be effective for all protected health information that we maintain at that time. Upon your request, we will provide you with any revised Notice of Privacy Practices. You may request a revised version by accessing our website, or calling the office and requesting that a revised copy be sent to you in the mail or asking for one at the time of your next appointment. </p>
                  <h3>1. Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information</h3>
                  <p>Your protected health information may be used and disclosed by your physician, our office staff and others outside of our office who are involved in your care and treatment for the purpose of providing health care services to you. Your protected health information may also be used and disclosed to pay your health care bills and to support the operation of your physician's practice. Following are examples of the types of uses and disclosures of your protected health information that your physician's office is permitted to make. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but to describe the types of uses and disclosures that may be made by our office. </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Treatment:</b> We will use and disclose your protected health information to provide, coordinate, or manage your health care and any related services. This includes the coordination or management of your health care with another provider. For example, we would disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to a home health agency that provides care to you. We will also disclose protected health information to other physicians who may be treating you. For example, your protected health information may be provided to a physician to whom you have been referred to ensure that the physician has the necessary information to diagnose or treat you. In addition, we may disclose your protected health information from time-to-time to another physician or health care provider (e.g., a specialist or laboratory) who, at the request of your physician, becomes involved in your care by providing assistance with your health care diagnosis or treatment to your physician.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Payment:</b> Your protected health information will be used and disclosed, as needed, to obtain payment for your health care services provided by us or by another provider. This may include certain activities that your health insurance plan may undertake before it approves or pays for the health care services we recommend for you such as: making a determination of eligibility or coverage for insurance benefits, reviewing services provided to you for medical necessity, and undertaking utilization review activities. For example, obtaining approval for a hospital stay may require that your relevant protected health information be disclosed to the health plan to obtain approval for the hospital admission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Health Care Operations:</b> We may use or disclose, as needed, your protected health information in order to support the business activities of your physician's practice. These activities include, but are not limited to, quality assessment activities, employee review activities, training of medical students, licensing, fundraising activities, and conducting or arranging for other business activities. We will share your protected health information with third party 'business associates' that perform various activities (for example, billing or transcription services) for our practice. Whenever an arrangement between our office and a business associate involves the use or disclosure of your protected health information, we will have a written contract that contains terms that will protect the privacy of your protected health information. We may use or disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to provide you with information about treatment alternatives or other health- related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. You may contact our Privacy Officer to request that these materials not be sent to you.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Other Permitted and Required Uses and Disclosures That May Be Made Without Your Authorization or Opportunity to Agree or Object.</h3>
                  <p>We may use or disclose your protected health information in the following situations without your authorization or providing you the opportunity to agree or object. These situations include.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Required By Law:</b> We may use or disclose your protected health information to the extent that the use or disclosure is required by law.

                  <p>
                    <b>You have the right to inspect and copy your protected health information.</b> This means you may inspect and obtain a copy of protected health information about you for so long as we maintain the protected health information. [cite: 87, 88] You may obtain your medical record that contains medical and billing records and any other records that your physician and the practice uses for making decisions about you. As permitted by federal or state law, we may charge you a reasonable copy fee for a copy of your records. Under federal law, however, you may not inspect or copy the following records: psychotherapy notes; information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or use in, a civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding; and laboratory results that are subject to law that prohibits access to protected health information. [cite: 91, 92, 93] Depending on the circumstances, a decision to deny access may be reviewable. [cite: 94, 97] In some circumstances, you may have a right to have this decision reviewed. Please contact our Privacy Officer if you have questions about access to your medical record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>You have the right to request a restriction of your protected health information.</b> This means you may ask us not to use or disclose any part of your protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations. [cite: 99, 100] You may also request that any part of your protected health information not be disclosed to family members or friends who may be involved in your care or for notification purposes as described in this Notice of Privacy Practices. Your request must state the specific restriction requested and to whom you want the restriction to apply. Your physician is not required to agree to a restriction that you may request. If your physician does agree to the requested restriction, we may not use or disclose your protected health information in violation of that restriction unless it is needed to provide emergency treatment. With this in mind, please discuss any restriction you wish to request with your physician.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>You have the right to request to receive confidential communications from us by alternative means or at an alternative location.</b> We will accommodate reasonable requests. [cite: 106, 107] We may also condition this accommodation by asking you for information as to how payment will be handled or specification of an alternative address or other method of contact. We will not request an explanation from you as to the basis for the request. Please make this request in writing to our Privacy Officer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>You may have the right to have your physician amend your protected health information.</b> This means you may request an amendment of protected health information about you in a designated record set for so long as we maintain this information. [cite: 110, 111] In certain cases, we may deny your request for an amendment. If we deny your request for amendment, you have the right to file a statement of disagreement with us and we may prepare a rebuttal to your statement and will provide you with a copy of any such rebuttal. Please contact our Privacy Officer if you have questions about amending your medical record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures we have made, if any, of your protected health information.</b> This right applies to disclosures for purposes other than treatment, payment or health care operations as described in this Notice of Privacy Practices. [cite: 115, 116] It excludes disclosures we may have made to you if you authorized us to make the disclosure, for a facility directory, to family members or friends involved in your care, or for notification purposes, for national security or intelligence, to law enforcement (as provided in the privacy rule) or correctional facilities, as part of a limited data set disclosure.

                  </p>
                  <h3>3. Complaints</h3>
