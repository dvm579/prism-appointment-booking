                  <h4>1. Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information</h4>
                  <p>Your protected health information may be used and disclosed by your physician, our office staff and others outside of our office who are involved in your care and treatment for the purpose of providing health care services to you. Your protected health information may also be used and disclosed to pay your health care bills and to support the operation of your physician's practice. Following are examples of the types of uses and disclosures of your protected health information that your physician's office is permitted to make. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but to describe the types of uses and disclosures that may be made by our office. </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Treatment:</b> We will use and disclose your protected health information to provide, coordinate, or manage your health care and any related services. This includes the coordination or management of your health care with another provider. For example, we would disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to a home health agency that provides care to you. We will also disclose protected health information to other physicians who may be treating you. For example, your protected health information may be provided to a physician to whom you have been referred to ensure that the physician has the necessary information to diagnose or treat you. In addition, we may disclose your protected health information from time-to-time to another physician or health care provider (e.g., a specialist or laboratory) who, at the request of your physician, becomes involved in your care by providing assistance with your health care diagnosis or treatment to your physician.

                  <p>
                    <b>Payment:</b> Your protected health information will be used and disclosed, as needed, to obtain payment for your health care services provided by us or by another provider. This may include certain activities that your health insurance plan may undertake before it approves or pays for the health care services we recommend for you such as: making a determination of eligibility or coverage for insurance benefits, reviewing services provided to you for medical necessity, and undertaking utilization review activities. For example, obtaining approval for a hospital stay may require that your relevant protected health information be disclosed to the health plan to obtain approval for the hospital admission.
                  </p>
                  <p>

These activities include, but are not limited to, quality assessment activities, employee review activities, training of medical students, licensing, fundraising activities, and conducting or arranging for other business activities. We will share your protected health information with third party 'business associates' that perform various activities (for example, billing or transcription services) for our practice. Whenever an arrangement between our office and a business associate involves the use or disclosure of your protected health information, we will have a written contract that contains terms that will protect the privacy of your protected health information. We may use or disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to provide you with information about treatment alternatives or other health- related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. You may contact our Privacy Officer to request that these materials not be sent to you.

                      <p>This consent allows Prism to (1) review school health records and provide a free record check & consultation, and (2) deliver screening, education, outreach, and clinical services as indicated by clinical judgment, including physical exams, immunizations, laboratory testing, brief evaluation/treatment, health education, and referrals/navigation.</p>
                      
                      <h4>A) Consent to Services</h4>
                      <p>I consent to Prism Foundation/Prism Health ("Prism") reviewing my/my child's school health records and providing screening, education, outreach, and clinical services as needed for school readiness. I understand this is not a comprehensive medical order or full plan of care; additional provider forms may be required for chronic conditions.</p>
                      <p><strong>A1. Vaccine information.</strong> I will receive/read CDC Vaccine Information Statements for any vaccines; I understand risks/benefits and that no outcome can be guaranteed. Immunization data may be shared with the state registry (IDPH I-CARE) and/or via the state health information exchange, subject to state opt-out. Unless I limit in writing, this consent covers any age-appropriate immunizations recommended by CDC/ACIP for school or routine care; I may decline any specific vaccine at the time of service.</p>
                      <p><strong>A2. Health history.</strong> For a comprehensive school physical, the health history section of the State "Certificate of Child Health Examination" may be required.</p>
                      
                      <h4>B) Authorization to Obtain/Use/Disclose Information</h4>
                      <p><strong>B1. I-CARE immunization registry.</strong> I authorize Prism, as an IDPH I-CARE user, to query, retrieve, and update my/my child's immunization history to verify school requirements, coordinate care, and document vaccines given.</p>
                      <p><strong>B2. School & health agency coordination.</strong> I authorize Prism to use/disclose immunization information (e.g., vaccine types/dates, I-CARE printouts when necessary) and other relevant PHI to: my child's school and district (including CPS/Board of Education of the City of Chicago), ISBE, IDPH (including I-CARE/HIE), CDPH, HFS/Medicaid and managed-care plans, my/our health-care clinicians/clinics, school-based health centers, FQHC partners, clinical labs, pharmacies, and payers to arrange/provide/pay for services.</p>
                      <p><strong>B3. Term, revocation & re-disclosure.</strong> This authorization is voluntary and valid for 365 days from signature unless revoked earlier in writing; revocation does not affect actions already taken. Information disclosed may be re-disclosed by recipients and may no longer be protected by HIPAA. Prism will not condition treatment/benefits on signing, except as reasonably necessary to complete services I request.</p>
                      
                      <h4>C) School Health Deadlines (acknowledgment)</h4>

Students may be temporarily excluded until records are on file.</p>
                      
                      <h4>D) Cost & Insurance Notice</h4>
                      <p>Record review/consultation is free. If I later request billable clinical services, I authorize Prism to submit claims, request that benefits be paid to Prism, and I agree to be financially responsible for any copays/coinsurance/deductibles and for services not covered by program funding. I will be clearly notified in advance of any out-of-pocket costs before services are provided or billed. Any patient-responsible amount is due at the time of service or, if Prism invoices me after the time of service, upon receipt of such invoice. (Many back-to-school events offer vaccines at no cost with no insurance or ID required.)</p>
                      
                      <h4>E) Communications (calls/texts/emails)</h4>
                      <p>I consent to Prism contacting me by phone, text (SMS), and/or email for record collection, scheduling, reminders, and results related to this program, including automated informational calls/texts. I may opt out of texts by replying STOP. Standard rates may apply.</p>
                      
                      <h4>F) Release / Hold Harmless (school, city & state partners)</h4>
                      <p>In consideration of services delivered at/with schools, public agencies, or community partners, I release, indemnify, and hold harmless: (i) the Board of Education of the City of Chicago (CPS); (ii) my child's school and district; (iii) the City of Chicago and CDPH; (iv) ISBE; (v) IDPH (including registries/HIEs); (vi) HFS/Medicaid; and (vii) Prism Foundation/Prism Health and all Providers/Co-Sponsors, together with their members, trustees, officers, employees, contractors, volunteers, agents, and representatives, from any and all claims, losses, injuries, damages, or liabilities to me or my child, known or unknown, arising in connection with participation in the program or receipt of services/materials, whether or not resulting in whole or part from the negligence of any released party, except for willful or wanton misconduct. If any part is held unenforceable, the remainder continues.</p>
                      
                      <h4>G) Special Situations & Privacy</h4>
                      <p>If a student is under DCFS guardianship, a substitute caregiver may not consent to routine care; DCFS consent must be obtained before services. I acknowledge that Prism's Notice of Privacy Practices is available upon request.</p>
